# Controls
## General
- `ESC`: quit
- `F`: outputs some performance information (FPS, vertex array size, etc..)
## Rendering
- `T`: whether to render text information or not. You should disable text rendering when a lot of cells are drawn for performance reasons.
Text rendering will automatically be disabled when you have zoomed out to far.
